# Health Watch
Hi everyone,
Welcome to Health Watch.

I made this as an optional project for school so it is not the best but it is intended to be a rudimentary fitness recording app.

It is made in python with the guizero library.

# Installation
<ul>
<li>Install Python 3</li>
<li>Download or clone all of the files. (You can get a zip from <a href="https://healthwatchfitness.000webhostapp.com/index.html">here</a>)</li>
<li>In a terminal window, type pip install guizero (or however you do it on mac or linux)</li>
<li>Run main.pyw</li>
</ul>

If you need to reset the app fully, run fullReset.py!

Thanks for visiting!
